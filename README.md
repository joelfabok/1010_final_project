# 1010_final_project


Once you have the servers up and running you will be able to view the entire site. Filling out the contact form will store items in a json 
file. Going to the login page and loging in with test and password will allow you to view all inputed content. On the login page there is also a page to sign up.
filling out the form stores new users in json file and hashes the password. I am not able to figure out how to have them be able to login on the login page yet.
